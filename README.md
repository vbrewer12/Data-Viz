# Pymaceuticals Research Report

### This project analyzes data from a pre-clinical study conducted by Pymaceuticals, Inc., a pharmaceutical company specializing in anti-cancer treatments. The study examines the effectiveness of different drug regimens in treating squamous cell carcinoma in mice. The primary focus is on evaluating the performance of the company's drug of interest, Capomulin, compared to other treatments. 
### Here is the breakdown of the task list you will find:

- Prepare the data
- Create Bar charts and pie charts
- Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot
- Create a line plot and a scatter plot
- Calculate correlation and regression
- Explain my final analysis

### This study included data on 249 mice with various regimes over the course of 45 day.
### The two datasets used were:
- Mouse_metadata.csv: gender,,age, weight and treatment of each mouse
- Study_results.csv: tumor vol and time point for each mouse

## Results
<body> - Capomulin and Ramicane showed the most promising results for reducing tumor volume<br>
  - The linear regression model shows a strong correlation b/t mouse weight and tumor volume for Capomulin treatment
